### Node.js Express API Overview

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on the V8 engine, enabling server-side programming. Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.

An Express API allows developers to create RESTful services, making it easy to handle HTTP requests and responses. It supports various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD operations on resources.

# Key Features

 **Routing**: Express provides a powerful routing mechanism, allowing developers to define endpoints for different HTTP methods and URLs.
 **Middleware**: Express uses middleware functions to handle requests, responses, and error handling. Middleware can be used to parse request bodies, authenticate users, and more.
 **JSON Support**: Express easily handles JSON data, making it ideal for building APIs that communicate with front-end applications or other services.
 **Scalability**: Applications built with Express can easily scale to handle increasing loads and complexity.
